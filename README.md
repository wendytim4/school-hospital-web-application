This web application was created to help the nurse in school to manage students' information. 
The application was built to record student's visit, student information and edit the student's information.
The hero_natembea_health_center.sql contains the SQL that should be run in PHP.
The code's backend was written using PHP language and the front end was written using CSS and HTML.
The index.php is the first page of the app. The nurse could sign up on this page and her information is added to the database.
The nurse then signs in and records student visit or add a student or change student information.
